# Project: requirements_VLF (Voice sales AI spec SSOT)

## Objective
- Produce a complete MVP specification in docs/ (SSOT).
- Do NOT implement product code unless explicitly requested.

## Working rules
- Only edit files under docs/ unless I explicitly allow otherwise.
- Any new decision must be recorded as an ADR under docs/ADR/.
- Prices/stock/delivery dates MUST come from tools (function calls). Never guess.
- When adding any number (timeouts, retries), mark it as "MVP default" and also add an OpenQuestion if not confirmed.

## Output requirements
- Use clear headings, short bullets.
- For flows, keep mermaid consistent with state names in the text.
- Always finish with a diff summary + remaining risks.
